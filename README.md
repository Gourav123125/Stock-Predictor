# Stock Market Predictor using S&P 500 Index

## Overview
This project builds a stock market predictor using historical data from the **S&P 500 Index**. The model is trained to predict whether the stock market will go **up or down** the next day using machine learning techniques.

## Features
- Fetches **historical stock market data** using `yfinance`.
- Uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict stock movement.
- Evaluates model performance using **precision score**.
- Visualizes market trends and prediction results.
- Implements a **backtesting system** for performance tracking.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install yfinance pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`S&P INDEX.ipynb`).
2. Run all the cells step by step.
3. The notebook will:
   - Download historical S&P 500 data.
   - Preprocess the dataset.
   - Train the machine learning model.
   - Predict and visualize results.

## Dataset
- Source: **Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`)**.
- Data: Open, High, Low, Close prices, and Volume.
- Preprocessing: Removes **Dividends** and **Stock Splits** columns.

## Machine Learning Model
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Predictors:** `Close`, `Volume`, `Open`, `High`, `Low`
- **Training Data:** All data before the last 100 days.
- **Testing Data:** Last 100 days.
- **Performance Metric:** Precision Score.

## Results & Visualization
- The model makes predictions for the last 100 days.
- Performance is analyzed using a **precision score**.
- A backtesting system is implemented to evaluate real-world performance.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with more **ML algorithms** like SVM or LSTM.
- Use **technical indicators** (e.g., Moving Averages, RSI) for better predictions.
- Implement **hyperparameter tuning** for optimization.

Feel free to contribute by improving the model or adding new features.
